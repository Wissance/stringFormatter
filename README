This is a tiny GO module for template text formatting like in C# or/and Python

## Examples

#### Format by arg order
i.e. you have following template:  Hello {0}, we are greeting you here: {1}!

if you call Format with args "manager" and "salesApp" : Format("Hello {0}, we are greeting you here: {1}!", "manager", "salesApp")

you get string "Hello manager, we are greeting you here: salesApp!"

#### Format by arg key
i.e. you have following template: "Hello {user} what are you doing here {app} ?"

if you call FormatComplex with args "vpupkin" and "mn_console" FormatComplex("Hello {user} what are you doing here {app} ?", map[string]string{"user":"vpupkin", "app":"mn_console"})

you get string "Hello vpupkin what are you doing here mn_console ?"
